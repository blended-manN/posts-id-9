                    THE EMPEROR IS DEAD
                </strong>
            </h3>


            <p>
                <strong>
                    On March 3rd, 2025, the Emperor was stolen from the protection of the High Priestess and taken to a fort somewhere in Florida. For a week he was tortured by two men only known as the Evil Guys. Torture
                    included waterboarding, sliming, and hanging from a ceiling fan. Our clergy did not realize he was missing until two days later on March 5th. After unsuccessful negotiations with the Enemy,
                    Emperor Lord Sir Señor Mr. Follicle was executed at 11:47 UTC on March 6th, 2025. Sir Follicle was chopped into bits by the Evil Guys for all to see on their broadcast, which has since been taken
                    down by local governments. The Enemy has said that the High Priestess will receive the corpse in bits. Mrs. Follicle was so distraught by the news she has refused to comment for this post. However,
                    there is hope. A select few follicles have been known to revive into an avatar (another follicle). This is why it is customary to burn great enemy generals' corpses in follicle society to prevent them
                    from coming back to fight. If the Emperor is part of the select few, he could return in an avatar. For now, the Mrs. will be crowned Empress Lady Ma'am Señorita Mrs. Follicle of the Foliccites.
